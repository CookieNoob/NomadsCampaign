 - A Nomad ship encountered what is believed to be an Earth Empire Outpost. Gather intel about the current state of the Earth Empire and try to establish diplomatic relations.
what actually happens: UEF commander wants to confiscate the Nomad ship and quarantine/detain the crew. Defend yourself.
Final goal: Gather intel about the current state of the galaxy.
Objective 1:
- You, as the Commander of the Nomads 12th expeditionary fleet have been placed in-charge of the command ship and have landed it on the planet. Using our engineers, you must construct an outpost and maintain a sustainable income of resources. Establish a base and scout as quickly as possible. 
- You will contact the Earth Empire to discuss diplomatic relationships. The Nomads are low on resources, so you will only have access to Tech 1 units and buildings. 

Objective 2: 
- The Earth Empire Commander is sending a sizeable force to you. Get your engineers back to the ship and counter the Earth Empire's attacks!
    - Send 2/3 transports to attack the Nomads
    - Possibly send 2 UEF transports to the Command Centre
- You must defend the landed Command ship at all costs.
- You will start with Tech 1 (Heavy Air Play)

Objective 3:
- It's time to figure out what the hell is happening. Capture the Earth Empire Command Center and gather information about the current state of the galaxy. Our Tech's will try 
to obtain Earth Empire tech. 
- You will gain access to more Tech 1 Land by capturing a UEF Land Factory (Restrict Engineers)
- (Secondary): Commander, if you have spare resources, assault the Earth Empire power plant. This will deactivate the shields around their main base. 
- (Secondary): We need a counter measure sir. Construct a Tech 2 Air Factory to gain access to our air strikes. We will send some units to attack a small position, however they will return to the ship if they survive.

Objective 4:
Our Techs have uncovered the state of the galaxy. The Commander we're fighting is with a faction called the 'UEF'. This changes nothing. 
- (Secondary): Sir, it's time to go on the offensive. The UEF Commander strained his resources with those attacks and is now rebuilding his army. Take advantage of this break and attack his outposts!
- Your air support ability will become available over time sir, our planes need time to refuel and rearm. 
- Attack and kill the UEF Commander with all you have sir, we need to leave as soon as possible!

Defeat:
- UEF Commander damages the ship to an unrecoverable state. Thus resulting in an arrest, and you lose the mission.
